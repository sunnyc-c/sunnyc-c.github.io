# Introduction
Hey there! This is a project for myself to develop a personal website, mainly for blogging and photo alblum purpose.
Also serve as a project to start learning more about website building etc.

## Tools used
GitHub Pages is used in the project (obviously right?), also Jekyll. So many thanks to Jekyll that it makes so much easier and simpler for a newbie like me to build his own website.
