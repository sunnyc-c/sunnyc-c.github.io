    <h1>Confused Giraffe</h1>
<h2>Zoo Keeper</h2>

<p>Back in 2019, when Sunny was still a freshman, he was so confused that
he didn’t understand the purpose of the university email’s renaming. So, he
had named his email alias as “Confused Giraffe”.</p>

<p>He was so confused, and he is tall. That’s the origin of the confused giraffe.</p>
