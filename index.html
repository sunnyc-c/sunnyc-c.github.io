<h1> {{ "Welcome to Confused Giraffe's Pages" }}</h1>
<p>This site is still in development phase, so please don't be surprised if there's some bug or 404 shits.</p>
<p>Below is an older version of this page's introduction.</p>
<h2> Hello World! </h2>
<p>Lol so this is the page. <br> I'm using GitHub Pages. It's working if you can see it</p>
<p>I've made use of jekyll in this project, and I'm still learning about it.</p>
<p>So after using "jekyll serve", this webpage is updated immediately after refreshing the browser.</p>
<h2>This part is about jekyll</h2>
<p>Front matter can be used to set variable for the page. <br>
    E.g. I've set a variable named "my_var" as 5. The next line will display the value of the variable. <br>
    page.my_var: {{ page.my_var }}

</p>
<p>The editor of this page is {{ page.editor_name }}.</p>
